# `08` Calculated property.

Some class properties are calculated because you need to run a small algorithm
to get their value. For example, a person's age is calculated, because it changes
over time. Instead of storing the current age, it's better to store the birthdate
and calculate the age every time we want it, with a function like this:

```py
```

The following class **Person** has the function **get_age** to calculate a person's age.

## 📝 Instructions:
1. Please create a new function called **can_drinkAlcohol** that returns a boolean true or false
depending on the person's legal right to drink alcohol.

## 💡Hint:
- return **true** if age is greater than or equal to 21
- return **false** otherwise
