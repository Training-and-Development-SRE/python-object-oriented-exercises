# `02` Create a new class

To create a new class in Python, we have to write the following code:

```Python
class ClassName:
    <statement-1>
    .
    .
    .
    <statement-N>
```
with ClassName being the name of the class that you want to define.



## 📝 Instructions:

1. Define a new class called Person.


## 💡Hint:
If you don't declare the class properly, you will get this error on the console:
```Python
NameError: name 'ClassName' is not defined
```
