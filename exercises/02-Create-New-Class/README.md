# `02` Create a new class

To create a new class in Python, we have to write the following code:

```Python
class ClassName:
    pass
```
with ClassName being the name of the class that you want to define.



## üìù Instructions:

1. Define a new class called Person.


## üí°Hint:
- If you don't declare the class properly, you will get this error on the console:
```Python
NameError: name 'ClassName' is not defined
```
- You can use the **pass** statement when you just define a class.
- The pass statement is a null operation; nothing happens when it executes. The pass
is also useful in places where your code will eventually go, but has not been written yet
(e.g., in stubs for example).
