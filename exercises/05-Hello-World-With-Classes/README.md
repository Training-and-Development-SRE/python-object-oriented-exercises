# `05` Hello World with classes.
To define a new class, you have to use the following syntax:



```Python
class ClassName:

    def __init__(self, foo1, foo2):
        # constructor code


```
In this particular exercise (on the left), you have a class called Printer already declared.


## üìù Instructions:
1. Create a new object instance of the class **Printer** and assign it to a variable called **my_printer**.
2. Call the function **printer_test** of the class **Printer** and store the result in a variable called **test_result**
3. Print on the console **test_result** content.
