# `06` Print with the class Printer.
The given **Printer** class has one function **printer_test** (just like the test in real-life printers).
You can have several functions inside class declarations; actually, there is no limit to the
number of functions you can have! You declare the new functions anywhere inside the class scope
as a sibling of the other functions like this:

```py
class ClassName:

    def first_function():
        # function body
    def second_function():
        # function body
    def third_function():
        # function body


```


## 📝 Instructions:
1. Please write a second function called **get_model** that returns the current printer model.

## 💡Hint:
- Declare the new function inside the class **Printer**.
- The function needs to return the content of the model variable.
