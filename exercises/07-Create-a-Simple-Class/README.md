# `07` Create a simple class.

Right now, there is a Counter class declared that contains 4 functions:

- **constructor**: This function will initialize the value of the counter.
- **increase_one**: This function will increase the value of the counter by one.
- **decrease_one**: This function will decrease the value of the counter by one.
- **get_value**: This function will return the value of the counter.

All functions are empty and your job is to fill them with the proper code needed to make it work as expected.


## 📝 Instructions:
1. Fill the content of the class **Counter** to make it behave as expected.

## 💡Hint:
- Initialize a variable self.counter and use it in every function.
- If your class behaves as expected, the output in the console should be:

```py
1
3
1

```
